      <description>This is part 2 of my journey learning Golang.
Compiling Go programs An individual Go source file can be compiled with the go build command:
1go build {filename}.go The resulting binary can be executed with this command:
1./{filename} Example:
1$ go build main.go 2$ ./main 3Hello World Running from source The go run command combines the two previous steps: it builds a binary from a source file and executes it:</description>

      <description>This is part 1 of my journey learning Golang.
The Go programming language (Golang) is becoming more relevant by the day. It is, famously, the language of the Docker and Kubernetes projects. Both have had a huge impact on how companies run applications, and I develop for them on a daily basis. Golang is also seeing increased adotoption at my company.
I&amp;rsquo;m starting on a journey to become more familiar with this language.</description>

      <title>Custom domain with GitHub Pages</title>

      <description>I am hosting my blog on GitHub Pages. I wanted to use my own domain name instead of a github.io subdomain.
GitHub&amp;rsquo;s documentation is very helpful. Even so, it took me some effort to figure out all the details, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to share what I learned.
These instructions are for using an &amp;ldquo;apex domain&amp;rdquo; e.g. fernandocorreia.dev. The settings are a bit different when using a subdomain like www.fernandocorreia.dev. Again, GitHub&amp;rsquo;s documentation is very helpful and does a good job of explaining these differences.</description>

      <description>I decided to start a new blog to talk about software development.
It&amp;rsquo;s been about 5 years since I last had a blog, so I went looking for what people are using in 2020.
It turns out that Hugo is quite popular for building static sites.
Two of its selling points are that it is super fast, and that people have built hundreds of good-looking themes so that you can hit the ground running.</description>
