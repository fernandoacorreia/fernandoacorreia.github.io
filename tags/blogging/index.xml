      <title>Custom domain with GitHub Pages</title>

      <description>I am hosting my blog on GitHub Pages. I wanted to use my own domain name instead of a github.io subdomain.
GitHub&amp;rsquo;s documentation is very helpful. Even so, it took me some effort to figure out all the details, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to share what I learned.
These instructions are for using an &amp;ldquo;apex domain&amp;rdquo; e.g. fernandocorreia.dev. The settings are a bit different when using a subdomain like www.fernandocorreia.dev. Again, GitHub&amp;rsquo;s documentation is very helpful and does a good job of explaining these differences.</description>

      <description>I decided to start a new blog to talk about software development.
It&amp;rsquo;s been about 5 years since I last had a blog, so I went looking for what people are using in 2020.
It turns out that Hugo is quite popular for building static sites.
Two of its selling points are that it is super fast, and that people have built hundreds of good-looking themes so that you can hit the ground running.</description>
