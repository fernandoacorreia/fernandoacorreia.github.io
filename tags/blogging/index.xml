      <description>I decided to start a new blog to talk about software development.
It&amp;rsquo;s been about 5 years since I last had a blog, so I went looking for what people are using in 2020.
It turns out that Hugo is quite popular for building static sites.
Two of its selling points are that it is super fast, and that people have built hundreds of good-looking themes so that you can hit the ground running.</description>
